# GroupBoxPlus v1.0.0

Adds functionality to a standard Mendix groupbox allowing the groupbox to start open or closed based on user role or a microflow, as well as the jQuery `.slideUp()` and `.slideDown()` animations.

## Instructions

1. Install the widget in your project.
2. Insert the widget as a child widget of a group box
3. If you would like to configure the default start state by role (open/closed), add the name of the user role (exactly as shown in your project security) and whether or not the groupbox should start open in the properties of the custom widget
4. If you would like to configure the default state state by microflow (i.e. show the group box expanded if there's some data there)
